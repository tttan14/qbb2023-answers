1Mbp*3=3Mbp
3Mbp/100bp reads=0.03M reads

1.3
In the simulation, there are 49809 bases with 0 coverage
This is 4.9809% of the genome.
The distribution did not match the Poisson expectation very well. And the distribution fit normal expectations worse than the Poission.

1.4
In the simulation, there are 96 bases with 0 coverage
This is 0.009600000000000001% of the genome.
The distribution matches the Poisson expectation well. And the distribution fit normal expectations also well and seemingly better.

1.5
In the simulation, there are 0 bases with 0 coverage
This is 0.0% of the genome.
The distribution matches the both Poisson and normal expectations very well.
