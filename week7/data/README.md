Q1: mostly methylated

2: unique site number in bisulfite:  132466
unique site number in bisulfite percentage:  2.9908053720974968 %
unique site number in nanopore:  53346
unique site number in nanopore percentage:  1.2263482106157535 %
shared site number:  4296642
shared site number as percentage with bisulfite:  97.0091946279025 %
shared site number as percentage with nanopore:  98.77365178938425 %

nanopore calling is more shifted to the right. The higher coverage gives more confidence. Nanopore is the better method.

34: Nanopore more sensitive as long reads. 
5: In tumor cell line, there is less methylation across the chromosome.

6: Imprinting is silencing a gene through methylation where methylated allele is methylated. 
7: it showed connected lines of 2 in the phased tracks. It's required to know the haplotype information
8: Not every set can be phased since it depend on whether information about the haplotype is provided. Long reads like nanopore is more likely to give such information.
