2: peaks were more retained with sample2 for the combined bed than compared to sample1 

3: There are mostly overlaps between the samples and consistent with the wig tracks. I think it's reproducible and better with more replicates. It is relatively consistent. P-values represent the statistical significance and confidence of peaks. The reproducibility of peaks can be due to many other factors other than p-values including enrichment/background.
